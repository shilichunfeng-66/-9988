# Academic Figures — Pitfalls

## matplotlib not found in Hermes venv

The hermes-agent runs in its own venv (`~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/`), NOT the system python. If `gen_figure.py` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'`, install into the correct venv:

```bash
which python3
python3 -m pip install matplotlib numpy
```

Do NOT use `pip3 install --break-system-packages` — that installs into `/usr/lib/python3/`, which the hermes agent doesn't use.

## SKILL.md File Structure Stale

SKILL.md's File Structure section references `scripts/extract_lab_pdf.py` which was never created. The extraction technique lives in `references/chinese-lab-report-extraction.md` as reusable code snippets. Do not reference a nonexistent script.

## CJK font detection issues

If `--cjk` flag fails to find fonts, check:
```bash
fc-list :lang=zh | head -5
```
If fonts exist but CJK rendering shows boxes, the venv's matplotlib cache may be stale. Clear it:
```bash
python3 -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.get_cachedir())"
rm -rf <that_path>
```

## Clinical Lab Trend Figures: Never Share Y-Axis Across Magnitudes

When making multi-panel lab parameter figures for case reports, each indicator MUST have its own panel with independent Y-axis. Example failure: mixing CRP (~200 mg/L), Ferritin (~1200 ng/mL), and Hb (~80 g/L) on the same axis produces an unreadable chart. User explicitly rejected such an attempt. See `references/clinical-lab-trends.md` for the correct N-panel grid pattern.

## White background is MANDATORY (zero tolerance)

This skill generates **publication-quality figures for journal submissions** (Nature, Lancet, Science). All output MUST use white background (`facecolor='white'`).

**NEVER add a dark/black theme.** Dark backgrounds are only for presentation slides or tech blogs — NOT academic publications. This rule was violated once (v1.5.0 dev) and the user corrected it firmly. The `save_kwargs["facecolor"]` is hardcoded to `'white'` and must not be changed.

If a user asks for a dark-themed chart, redirect them to the `data-viz` or `creative` skills instead.

## Hatching: ALL bars must have patterns

When `--hatch` is enabled, **every** bar series gets a hatching pattern — not just the second series. The original GLM-5.2 blog figures (the design reference) show hatching on both short and tall bars. This was corrected by the user: "高、矮柱状图都是有斜纹的".

`HATCH_PATTERNS` has NO `None` entry — the first item is `'//'` so even the first series gets hatched. Different patterns (`//`, `\\`, `||`, `--`, `++`, `xx`) distinguish series even in black-and-white print.

**Hatch line color = black (`edgecolor='black'`)**, NOT a darkened version of the fill color. The original reference uses pure black `#000000` hatch lines on colored fills. Do not use `_darken_color()` for this — it produces inconsistent contrast on light fills like yellow.

## Color saturation: prefer muted/elegant over vibrant

The user explicitly rejected vibrant/saturated colors (`#2563EB`, `#F97316`) as "油腻俗气" (greasy/tacky). Publication figures should use **muted, low-saturation tones** — the aesthetic is 素雅 (elegant/underated).

The `glm` theme uses pixel-extracted colors from the GLM-5.2 blog:
- Blue: `#70A0D0` (dusty blue, NOT `#2563EB`)
- Orange: `#D09050` (sandy/khaki orange, NOT `#F97316`)
- Green: `#30B080` (muted teal-green)

When creating new themes or adjusting colors, keep saturation low. A good rule: if a color looks like it belongs on a startup landing page, it's too saturated for an academic figure.

### Cool theme: user's go-to for non-submission work (v1.5.2+)

The user explicitly rejected Okabe-Ito's warm colors (orange `#E69F00`, green `#009E73`, yellow `#F0E442`, vermilion `#D55E00`) as "大红大绿大黄" when generating demo figures. They requested "素雅的冷色调配色" instead.

The `cool` theme was created in direct response:
- All 8 colors in hue range 190-260° (blue-cyan-teal-slate)
- Zero warm colors (no red, orange, yellow, magenta)
- Colorblind-safe (all distinguishable in protanopia/deuteranopia)
- Low-medium saturation (editorial, not startup-y)

**User preference rule**: For journal submissions → `--theme okabe-ito` (colorblind compliance required). For everything else (demos, blog, presentations, video figures) → `--theme cool` is the default. When generating multiple chart types for this user, use `--theme cool` unless they specifically ask for something else.

## How to extract exact colors from a reference image

When a user provides a reference image and asks you to match its color scheme, do NOT guess — extract pixel data:

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

img = Image.open('reference.png')
arr = np.array(img)
# Round to nearest 16 for grouping, find dominant non-white/black colors
pixels = arr[:, :, :3].reshape(-1, 3)
rounded = (pixels // 16 * 16).astype(int)
colors = Counter(map(tuple, rounded))
# Top colors by frequency → actual fill colors used in the chart
```

For hatching detection: scan brightness along a single column through a bar interior. Alternating bright/dark bands = hatching. Check both horizontal and vertical directions to determine if lines are diagonal.

See `references/reverse-engineering-colors.md` for a complete worked example.

## Composite figures: tight_layout conflict

Composite charts (`-t composite`) use GridSpec internally and call `fig.add_subplot()` directly. The main `plt.tight_layout()` call is **skipped** for composite/diagram types (signaled by the generator returning the string `"composite"` or `"diagram"`). If you add new self-managed chart types, ensure they return a sentinel string from the generator function so `main()` skips both `apply_base_style()` and `tight_layout()`.

## KM median_survival: null values crash axvline (fixed v1.5.0+)

If `median_survival` JSON contains a `null` value for a group (e.g., median not reached):
```json
"median_survival": {"Treatment": null, "Control": 22}
```
The original code called `ax.axvline(x=None)` which raises `TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'NoneType'`.

**Fix (v1.5.0+)**: Added `if med_t is not None` guard before `axvline()`. Either omit the key entirely or set it to `null` — both work now. Only groups with a numeric median get a vertical dotted line.

## KM log_rank.p must be float, not string (v1.5.2+)

If `log_rank.p` is set to a string like `"<0.001"` instead of a float, `gen_km()` crashes:

```
TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'float'
```

**Code-level fix (v1.5.2)**: `gen_km()` now coerces `p` to float at read time:
```python
p_val = float(log_rank.get("p", 1.0))  # defensive: handles "0.001" strings too
```

**Data-level rule**: Always use numeric values in JSON: `"p": 0.001` not `"p": "<0.001"`.

Discovered when 4 composite KM panels (c12, c16, c17, c19) failed during a 23-layout demo session.

## Scatter groups array: length must match x/y (fixed v1.5.0+)

In composite panels using scatter, the `groups` array must be the same length as `x`/`y`. If they mismatch (e.g., you built the arrays separately and forgot to extend groups), you get `IndexError: index N is out of bounds`.

**Fix (v1.5.0+)**: Code now truncates `groups` to `min(len(x), len(y))` automatically. But always ensure your JSON data is consistent — validate `len(x) == len(y) == len(groups)` before passing to the generator.

## Diagram coordinate system

The diagram type uses an arbitrary coordinate space (not data coordinates). Block positions (`x`, `y`, `w`, `h`) are in abstract units. The axis limits auto-expand to fit all blocks with 1-1.5 units padding. Arrow connection points are calculated at block edges (midpoint of the facing edge). For complex layouts, plan block positions on paper first.
